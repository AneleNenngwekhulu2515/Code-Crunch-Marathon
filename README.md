# Code Crunch Marathon - Python Projects

Welcome to the **Code Crunch Marathon** repo! This repository is designed for mentees participating in a full day of Python learning and coding. Here, you'll find several Python projects that you'll be working on throughout the day.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository
First, fork this repository to your own GitHub account to make it easier for you to commit changes and push your work.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Once you've forked the repo, clone it to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/code-crunch-marathon.git
```

## Problem Solving: Breaking Down a Problem with Flow Diagrams


Before you start coding, it's important to break down a problem into smaller, manageable steps. One way to do this is through **flow diagrams**. Below is an explanation on how to break down a problem and structure it visually:

### 1. Define the Problem
Clearly state what the problem is. For example, "Build a calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations."

### 2. Identify Inputs and Outputs
For each problem, determine:

- **Inputs**: What information do you need to start the process? In the case of a calculator, this could be two numbers and an operation (e.g., addition).
- **Outputs**: What should be the result? For the calculator, this would be the calculated result (e.g., 5 + 3 = 8).

### 3. Break Down the Steps
Write down each step needed to solve the problem. For example:

1. Get user input (number 1, number 2, operation).
2. Check if the operation is valid.
3. Perform the operation.
4. Output the result.

### 4. Create the Flow Diagram
A flow diagram helps visualize these steps. Here's an example breakdown for a simple calculator:

## Generating an SSH Key

To securely connect with GitHub (or any other service) via SSH, you'll need to generate an SSH key pair on your system. Below are the steps to generate SSH keys on both Windows (without Git Bash) and Linux.

### Generating SSH Key on Windows (Using Command Prompt or PowerShell)

1. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell**:
   Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd` or `powershell`, and press `Enter`.

2. **Generate the SSH Key**:
   In the terminal, enter the following command:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen 
    ```
